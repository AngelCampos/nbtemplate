# nbtemplate

Template for open lab notebooks. To create a new lab notebook:

1. `mkdir project; cd project`
2. `git clone git@github.com:thephilross/nb-template.git`
3. `git remote remove origin`

Now you're ready to go! You can:

1. Customize it to your needs
2. Create a github repository to host your notebook on the gh-pages branch
3. Or just build and serve your notebook locally (assuming you have jekyll installed)

For serving your notebook locally I recommend using `jekyll serve --watch --config _config_dev.yml`
